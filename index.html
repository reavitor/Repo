				<h1>Capitalism</h1>
				<h3>Where a person can own private property and gain profit.</h3>
				<p>Capitlalism is a system where a individual can use his/her idea and make a profit. With the use of the "Working class" to use their labour to
			           further give legal tender and help the "working class." This kind of system relies on the indidual who pays off the "working class" and exploits
				   the workers to make more profit for the company

					<h1>Mixed Market Economy</h1>
					<p>
					A mixed economic system is an economic system that features characteristics of both capitalism 
				        and socialism. A mixed economic system protects the rights of public 
					property and capitalism, but also allows for governments to interfere in economic 
					activities in order to achieve social aims. In theory, mixed economies 
					are less efficient than pure free markets, but a lot of politicians argue 
					that the base conditions such as equal information and rational market cannot be acheived

				  <h1>Socialism</h1>
				  <p>What most people dont know is that true democracy lies in socialism. Let me explain.
				  Socialism is an economic system characterized by public ownership and centralized planning of all 
			           major industries (manufacturing, services, and energy), banks and insurance companies, 
			          agribusiness, transportation, the media, and medical facilities. Under capitalism, these giant 
			          enterprises dominate the economy but are privately owned and operated for the purpose of 
				  generating wealth for their owners by extracting it from working people who are paid only a 
				 small fraction of what their labor produces. Socialism turns this around so that the class that 
				 produces the wealth 
				  </p>
				  <section>
					  <p>can collectively decide how it will be used for the benefit of all. Back to what
			         I was saying. Socialism gives everyone the same and does not care on gender, age, race etc. </p>
