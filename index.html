			     <ol>
			         <li>own private property and gain profit</li>
				 <li>use his/her idea and make a profit</li>
				 <li>further give legal tender and help the "working class." This kind of system relies on the "working class" and employer</li>

				   <h1 style="font-size: 60px;">Mixed Market Economy</h1>
					<ol>
					  <li>protects the rights of public 
					property and capitalism, but also allows for governments to interfere in economic 
					activities in order to achieve social aims</li>
					  <li>mixed economies 
					are less efficient than pure free markets</li>
					   <li>Government places limits on the nature of business activity: restricting monopoly, control pollution from factories.</li>

				   <p>Communism was originally the political thought that concentrated on making everyone part of the 
			           working class. The idea for Communism, although well known before them, 
			           officially started with both Karl Marx and 
	                           Frederich Engels in The Communist Manifesto. 
				   </p>

			     <section>
				  <p>where they outlined their idea of complete equality between the people
				   They wanted a government where no one is starving and everyone has enough to survive. This was focused on the people. The main
					  problem is it limited working people with poor people. Some people were better than others
				     so this was a "handicap" to say the least.</p>
