				<h1>Capitalism</h1>
				<h3>Where a person can own private property and gain profit.</h3>
				<p>The word capitalism is now quite commonly used to describe the social system in which we now live. It is also often assumed that it 
				has existed, if not forever, then for most of human history. In fact, capitalism is a relatively new social system.
                                Capitalistism works with The working class that are paid to produce goods and services which are then sold for a profit. The 
				profit is gained by the capitalist class because they can make more money selling what we have produced than we cost to buy on 
			        the labour market.In this sense, the working class are exploited by the capitalist class. The capitalists
				live off the profits they obtain from exploiting the working class whilst reinvesting some of their profits
			        for a bigger amount of wealth. It is widely assumed that capitalism means a free market economy. But it 
				is possible to have capitalism without a free market. The systems that existed in the U.S.S.R and exist 
				in China and Cuba demonstrate this. These class-divided societies are widely called 'socialist'. A cursory 
				glance at what in fact existed there reveals that these countries were simply 'state capitalist'. In 
				supposedly 'socialist' Russia, for example, there still existed wage slavery, commodity production, 
				buying, selling and exchange, with production only taking place when it was viable to do so. 'Socialist' 
				Russia continued to trade according to the dictates of international capital and, like every other 
				capitalist, state, was prepared to go to war to defend its economic interests. The role of the Soviet 
				state became simply to act as the functionary of capital in the exploitation of wage labour, 
				setting targets for production and largely controlling what could or could not be produced. 
				We therefore feel justified in asserting that such countries had nothing to do with socialism as we 
				define it. In fact, socialism as we define it could not exist in one country aloneâ€”like capitalism 
				it must be a global system of society.
