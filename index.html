			     <ol>
			         <li>own private property and gain profit</li>
				 <li>use his/her idea and make a profit</li>
				 <li>further give legal tender and help the "working class." This kind of system relies on the "working class" and employer</li>

				   <h1 style="font-size: 60px;">Mixed Market Economy</h1>
					<ol>
					  <li>protects the rights of public 
					property and capitalism, but also allows for governments to interfere in economic 
					activities in order to achieve social aims</li>
					  <li>mixed economies 
					are less efficient than pure free markets</li>
					   <li>Government places limits on the nature of business activity: restricting monopoly, control pollution from factories.</li>

				  <h1 style="font-size: 60px;">Socialism</h1>
				  <p>What most people dont know is that true democracy lies in socialism. Let me explain.
				  Socialism is an economic system characterized by public ownership and centralized planning of all 
			           major industries (manufacturing, services, and energy), banks and insurance companies, 
			          agribusiness, transportation, the media, and medical facilities. Under capitalism, these giant 
			          enterprises dominate the economy but are privately owned and operated for the purpose of 
				  generating wealth for their owners by extracting it from working people who are paid only a 
				 small fraction of what their labor produces. Socialism turns this around so that the class that 
				 produces the wealth

				  <p>can collectively decide how it will be used for the benefit of all. Back to what
			         I was saying. Socialism gives everyone the same and does not care on gender, age, race etc. </p>

				   <h1 style="font-size: 60px;">Communism/Marxism</h1>  
				   <h3>Communism is a form of socialism with a twist.</h3>
				   <p>Communism was originally the political thought that concentrated on making everyone part of the 
			           working class. The idea for Communism, although well known before them, 
			           officially started with both Karl Marx and 
	                           Frederich Engels in The Communist Manifesto.

				  <p>where they outlined their idea of complete equality between the people
				   They wanted a government where no one is starving and everyone has enough to survive. This was focused on the people. The main
					  problem is it limited working people with poor people. Some people were better than others
				     so this was a "handicap" to say the least.</p>
